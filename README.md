# hellobot
A simple bot that uses Facebook's Wit.ai to Q&amp;A with the computer. It asks for customers' contact details. And it stores them in order to stay in touch. 
This is an experimental project and there is no guarantee whatsoever. The chatbot is supposed to interact with Facebook's wit.ai Natural Language Processing (NLP) servers.
So it uses some of its data to analyze the interactions of Hellobot. Such as the the degree of confidence given to the "understanding" of the customer's message. 
The responses may also use various other estimators such as the sentiment evaluation.
